# adventofcode2020
Advent of Code is a series of programming puzzles that come out Dec 1-25 every year. I always intend to do them, but then get distracted by other responsibilities.

This year, I'm streaming them to keep me accountable. All my code will be committed here, so you can follow along.

All code will be in ruby because ruby is awesome and I want to get people hype about ruby. :)
